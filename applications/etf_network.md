## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

This is a followup to [cryptex](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1660).

### Overview

The ETF Network (“encryption to the future”) is a substrate-based blockchain that uses a `proof-of-extract` consensus, enabling *timelock encryption*. In this followup grant proposal, we aim to develop secure delayed transactions through the ETF network, enabling trustless MPC protocols implemented as smart contracts. This will allow for use cases that are:

- Front-running resistant: the delayed transaction is encrypted with timelock encryption, ensuring no information can be gained prior to its execution (however, this is not true of finality, which we do not cover)
- Non-interactive: participants only need to submit a delayed transaction and wait for its execution, with no further participation required (e.g. no commit-reveal style interactions would be needed)
- Trustless and Predictable: Users can schedule transactions for the future, enabling use cases where they can rely on specific transaction executions as promised

The network uses identity-based encryption and DLEQ proofs to implement a “proof-of-extract” consensus mechanism, wherein validators leak IBE secret keys with each block produced. In our initial grant, we delivered a proof of authority version of our consensus mechanism, along with rust and typescript libraries for enabling timelock encryption in standalone libraries and in the browser, along with a proof-of-concept auction application. In this followup grant, we aim to ensure the security and scalability of the network by implementing a proof-of-stake version of the network using `dynamic-committee proactive secret sharing`. Additionally we implement a mechanism to use timelock encryption to delay transactions for future blocks by introducing a new type of proxy account, the `Future` proxy. We will revisit the sealed bid auction developed in our previous grant, using delayed transactions rather than timelocked bids. As a result, this demonstrates the ability to participate in non-interactive, trustless MPC protocols via smart contracts, or rather, for enabling MPC-as-a-Service. We will also develop browser-based tools (etf.js and a transaction manager dapp) that allows users to easily construct, manage, and monitor delayed transactions and a user's status as a Future proxy. Additionally, we aim to move one step closer to be a parachain by ensuring Cumulus compatibility and deploying our testnet to rococo, along with our auction platform.

### Project Details

This is a followup to our previous grant, in which we built the foundational layers of the ETF network. In this grant, we aim to make the network more decentralized and secure, and to approach production readiness for our system. In brief, this grant consists of four major pieces:

1. Implementation of a PoS version of consensus using Dynamic-Committee Proactive Secret Sharing
2. Development of Delayed Transactions and Timelock Auction V2.0
3. Delayed Transaction Explorer/Manager
4. Cumulus Compatibility and Rococo Deploy

#### Stake-Backed Proof of Extract with PSS

##### Background + Description

In order to ensure the scalability and security of the network, we will implement a direct proof-of-stake (since direct is simpler than delegated) version of our proof of extract mechanism, modeled after Babe. Babe functions in sequential epochs, where each epoch consists of a static number of non-overlapping sequential slots, with authority changes announced one epoch in advance (i.e. the new validator set). Potential block authors from the validator set use a VRF, using accumulated on-chain randomness, to generate a random number which determines if they can propose a block in any given slot. Along with this, our consensus mechnaism dictates that block authors must also calculate the IBE.EXTRACT function and provide a DLEQ proof, which block importers must verify along with the VRF signature. 

In a proof of stake model, we require that the network’s authority set (committee) should be dynamic, where authority membership can change between epochs, or where authorities may become unreachable during an epoch. In the initial version of our consensus mechanism, all authorities are also IBE master key custodians, each having complete knowledge of the IBE master secret, making it very difficult to securely add new authorities to the network without a large degree of centralization. A  verifiable secret sharing scheme (such as that used by [drand](https://drand.love/docs/cryptography/#verifiable-secret-sharing)) allows for secret shares to be publicly verified, however, it does not support a dynamic committee (drand has a static set of nodes, the League of Entropy). In order to realize this, we need to distribute the secret key in a way that allows outgoing committees (validator sets) to produce shares for incoming committees. A [proactive secret sharing scheme](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Amir-Herzberg/publication/221355399_Proactive_Secret_Sharing_Or_How_to_Cope_With_Perpetual_Leakage/links/02e7e52e0ecf4dbae1000000/Proactive-Secret-Sharing-Or-How-to-Cope-With-Perpetual-Leakage.pdf) allows for secret shares to be periodically refreshed, however, this still doesn’t meet the requirement, as it does not account for committee changes. Thus, we require a dynamic committee proactive secret sharing scheme. We intend to use the scheme detailed [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/971.pdf), which relies on a bivariate polynomial in order to build new keys for the next committee. We will perform additional research into the feasibility of replacing the paillier encryption used in the paper above with el gamal encryption instead, as it is also a homomorphic encryption scheme but boasts somewhat better performance (see [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02960.pdf)).

By properly handling the handoff of keys to upcoming committees, we can ensure that the membership of the validator set can be made dynamic while also preserving the security of the system.

##### Implementation

We will implement the dynamic committee proactive secret sharing (DPSS) mechanism using the Arkworks library, specifically making heavy usage of the arkworks/algebra crates.

In the blockchain runtime, we will use substrate’s [session management](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_session/trait.SessionManager.html) capabilities in order for validators to participate in the protocol, as well as to incentivize them to behave honestly. To be specific, we will use the session manager to integrate the ‘handoff’ between committees into consensus. Further, we will upgrade our node to run within a [TEE](https://polkadot.network/blog/trusted-execution-environments-and-the-polkadot-ecosystem) to ensure the security of the secret keys and their derivation.

Our network will then reward honest participants with our inflationary native token, else slash their stake if they behave adversarially. For example, for failing to participate in the protocol (by issuing invalid shares).

In addition, we will revisit the [timelock encryption](https://ideal-lab5.github.io/etf.html#timelock-encryption-with-etf-network) developed in the previous grant in order to account for the changes above.

#### Delayed Transactions

There are several mechanisms in place in substrate/polkadot to delay transaction execution, for example with the [scheduler pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/frame/scheduler/src/lib.rs), prototypes on a [delayed xcm queue](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/deferred-execution-of-xcmp-messages/2513), and of course the [time-delay proxy](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-proxies#time-delayed-proxy), but each solution is vulnerable to front-running attacks, among other implications of ‘knowing the future’. We propose to secure this process with timelock encryption, ensuring that transactions can remain encrypted until a scheduled future block. Apart from front-running protections, this also enables the development of trustless, atomic MPC protocols within smart contracts, a.k.a. MPC-as-a-Service. That is, contracts which allow multiple parties to commit to a protocol without revealing their input, and for that protocol to complete with no further interaction from the participants. In addition, delayed transactions done this way can add secure, decentralized escrow capabilities, for example by transferring a balance to a pure proxy and scheduling a timelocked encryption to add another address (recipient of the balance) and remove yourself (sender of the balance), while the transfer could still be stopped at any time prior to execution.


##### Overview + Design

The general idea is that we will modify the scheduler pallet so that it can perform decryption of encrypted, scheduled transactions through the usage of our [etf-sdk](https://github.com/ideal-lab5/etf-sdk). When encrypting transactions for future blocks in the chain, we run into the issue of nonce generation and verification. Normally, transaction nonces are monotonically increasing sequences starting at 1 (or 0). Any origin that encrypts a transaction for a future block must specify a nonce in the transaction, say k for example. By committing to this nonce, the account must only use at most nonce k-1 before the future transaction is executed, otherwise the nonce will be invalid. This is quite a major limitation for an account, as it essentially means the account needs to, at some point, *not* be able to execute anything. In order to solve this problem, we will introduce a new type of proxy account, the Future proxy. The Future proxy is an account that proxies its soft-derived children. Thus, an account, say //Alice, can soft-derive //Alice/0, //Alice/1, …, //Alice/k and act as a Future proxy for each, ensuring that she can have temporal flexibility for scheduled transactions.

##### Implementation

The implementation will work by first modifying the scheduler pallet to incorporate IBE decryption and verify the hash of the transaction within the `on_initialize` hook prior to verifying and dispatching the runtime call. We also create the new ‘Future’ proxy type and ensure that only future proxies can submit timelocked transactions. Secondly, we will update the etf.js library to provide utilities for preparing wrapped proxy calls, managing proxy and child accounts (i.e. to easily set yourself as the future proxy of specific children and a utility to ensure invalid transactions are not proposed (i.e. prevent nonce invalidity errors and prompt new account soft-derivation)), and to manage scheduled transactions from a browser. We will create a modified version of the scheduler pallet to be able to schedule, cancel, and replace timelocked transactions.

The diagram below depicts the general flow, where Alice, as a future proxy to Alice/0, signs Alice/0’s runtime call which will be executed by the scheduler at a future block k.

![delay-tx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ideal-lab5/Grants-Program/etf_network/static/img/delay_tx.png)



#### Timelock Auction Version 2: using timelocked transactions

In our previous grant we developed a timelock auction (https://auction.idealabs.network) which uses timelock encryption to seal bids for a future deadline. After the auction's deadline, the contract allows a ‘complete’ function to be called, which requires that ciphertexts (sealed bids) be decrypted offchain, then supplied to the contract (where the data is hashed and verified against original commitments). This is not ideal, as it first requires offchain computation in order to complete the auction, and secondly it either requires  that each participant calls the complete function, or else that they have a degree of trust that another participant called it with their unsealed bid. For more detailed information, see the docs [here](https://ideal-lab5.github.io/timelock_auction.html).

By introducing delayed transactions to the auction, we can make the process require less trust and to be non-interactive. By using delayed transactions as described above, we no longer need to perform the commit-reveal style interaction that is currently in place. Instead, participants only need to schedule a single transaction onchain and wait until the scheduled transactions are executed (at the ‘deadline’ block), after which payouts can immediately be claimed from the contract with no specific input from any other participants. That is, by performing the IBE decryption in the on_initilaize hook of the scheduler pallet, we no longer require the COMPLETE function that exists in version one of the contract.

To elaborate, the auction contract we built has two functions, BID and COMPLETE, as mentioned above. In version 1 of the contract, BID accepts a timelocked ‘bid’, which should decrypt to a bid amount, whereas COMPLETE expects the revealed, decrypted value (which it verifies by checking the hash). Above the auction is an orchestrator contract, which proxies calls to the auction (so all interaction is actually through the orchestrator). After an auction is finished, the orchestrator allows a CLAIM function to be called to claim a payout. To make this non-interactive with delayed transactions, this would look like preparing a wrapped, proxied transaction to call the BID function of the contract, passing a bid amount b. That is, Alice, acting as a future proxy for Alice/0, prepares a transaction like TX = (proxy.proxy(proxyAcct = Alice, acct = Alice/0, nonce = Alice/0.nonce + 1, BID(b))), then encrypts it for a future slot and schedules the transaction using the scheduler pallet. After the transaction is executed, the CLAIM function of the orchestrator can be invoked, with no need to “Complete” the auction.

#### Delayed Transaction Manager

We will build a dapp to provide a cohesive user experience in which they can manage future proxy status and proxied accounts and to manage and monitor delayed transactions. We have not decided on a specific visualization yet, but have instead a well-defined list of requirements and interactions. We intend to amend this proposal prior to Milestone 4 to supply more in depth information regarding this piece. The transaction manager would play an important role in bringing visibility about the ETF Network activity, along with providing tools for orchestrating flows of chained delayed transactions (transactions that would be executed based on a predefined sequence).

**Future Proxy Manager**
The future proxy manager is the entrypoint to being able to use delayed transactions. It will incorporate tools to:
- Allow account connections
- Set an account as a future proxy
- Set or remove an account as a proxy for child accounts
- Soft-derive child accounts

**Scheduler UI**
The scheduler module will allow users to construct transactions and/or chain of transactions through a visual interface. Users would be able to schedule transactions to be executed in the future, either independently or as part of a chain of transactions. A chain of transactions is a set of transactions that would be executed if one or more previous transactions stated as pre-requirements have been executed previously. It will incorporate tools to:
- Construct, sign, encrypt, and schedule transactions for future blocks
- Define chains of transactions.
- Cancel or replace scheduled transactions
- Warn on invalid nonces and prompt new child derivation

**Explorer UI**
The explorer module will allow visualization of scheduled transactions and provide options to get details during their lifecycle. It will incorporate tools to:
- Query/Search scheduled transactions (past and future).
- View detailed information on scheduled transactions, including which child account was used.
- Monitor the execution of scheduled transactions, and chains of transactions through a visual interface.
- Subscribe to get notifications about status changes on specific scheduled transactions.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

ETF Network is a substrate-based chain, with most of our tools being dependent on tools built by parity and others in the community (e.g. heavy usage of polkadotjs, smoldot, substrate-connect). Beyond being a substrate-based chain, we aim to become a parachain and provide the capability to delay transactions from any other parachain. 

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
	
At this stage, our target audience includes developers and designers who may want to incorporate timelock encryption into their applications. As we strive to eventually provide delayed transaction capabilities in a cross-chain way (with XCM), our target audience also includes other parachains, and developers on other chains who would want to use delayed transactions.

- What need(s) does your project meet?

ETF Network enables timelock encryption, which allows us to develop the delayed transactions mechanism and ultimately act as an MPC-as-a-Service layer. This solves several problems that exist in web3 systems, most notably front-running, by allowing scheduled transactions to remain secret until desired.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?

Not exactly. To the best of our knowledge, there are no projects that accomplish timelock encryption in the ecosystem. The most similar could be [Oak](https://oak.tech/), which allows transactions to be scheduled for future times, however, they do not use timelock encryption.

Outside of the ecosystem, [drand](https://drand.love/) is the most similar project, which this proposal takes some inspiration from. Unlike drand, however, which relies on the “League of Entropy” nodes to produce randomness, we will rely on our consensus mechanism instead, as we don’t explicitly tout ourselves as a randomness beacon.

### Tony Riemer

I am an engineer and math-lover with a passion for exploring new ideas. I studied mathematics at the University of Wisconsin and subsequently worked at [Fannie Mae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannie_Mae) and then [Capital One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_One), where I mainly focused on fintech products, including systems for loan servicing, efficient real-time pricing algorithms, and automation of critical customer needs. Since early 2022, I've been working exclusively in the web3 space, including having worked on previous web3 foundation grants [here](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/iris.md) and [here](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/iris_followup.md) and as an independent consultant. Beyond the web3-sphere, I have dabbled in many open source projects as well as have built several of my own, ranging from computer vision, machine learning, to IoT and video games. In January 2023, I attended (and graduated from) the Polkadot Blockchain Academy in Buenos Aires. Most recently, I have completed a web3 foundation grant which built the initial version of the ETF network.

### Carlos Montoya
I have been doing software for more than 20 years, most recently in the startup world. I am currently building the ETF Network as part of our mission at Ideal Labs. My passion for web3 started a couple of years ago during covid. I started my journey building smart contracts with solidity, and took part in some boot-camps and hackathons through 2021 and 2022. I built several apps, one of them a decentralized job-board protocol called [web3Jobs](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/web3jobsfevm-inz64) ([Repo](https://github.com/encode-g2-project)). Early this year I had the fortune to participate in the PBA hosted in Buenos Aires, and I have been in love with Substrate and Rust since then. The ETF Network idea emerged during my time in the academy. Furthermore, since early 2021 I have been building [TeamClass](https://www.teamclass.com) as CTO and partner. TeamClass is a b2b marketplace for helping companies with their team-building initiatives through virtual events. Previously, between 2016 and 2020 I was focused on building [StellarEmploy](https://www.stellaremploy.com) with my co-founders, where we had the opportunity to participate in NY ERA (Accelerator), and got institutional capital. StellarEmploy's technology was recently acquired by Learning Collider. Finally, between 2004 and 2015, I was CTO and Chief Architect at [MVM Software Engineering](https://www.mvm.com.co/?lang=en), a technology firm focused on power energy solutions. During my time there I had the responsibility of defining the way of doing software for the entire company, leading very skilled people, building complex software products, and managing hundreds of initiatives for helping the company to expand its operations in Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico. 

### Valentina Gomez

I'm a financial engineer who has successfully transitioned into the world of software development. Over the past two years, I've immersed myself in web development, using technologies such as Next.js, GraphQL, ReactJS, and MongoDB to create interactive functionalities on TeamClass web platform.
With an eye on the future and a strong curiosity to comprehend the technologies behind cryptocurrencies, such as Blockchain, and explore their potential applications in another fields, I've taken steps into the world of web3 and blockchain by attending  the Polkadot Blockchain Academy in Berkeley, California, where I get the essential skills to navigate this revolutionary domain.
